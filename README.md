# Tableau Data Analytics

## Overview
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard visualizing **sales, tax, and profit data** across different products, years, and countries.


## Key Insights

### Visualizations
1. **Product vs Sales** – Bar chart showing sales distribution across product categories.
2. **Year vs Sales** – Line chart showing sales trends over time.
3. **Country vs Sales** – Map visualization displaying sales by geographical location. I have also attached a link to know about each country when it is clicked.

- **Product Filter** – Enables filtering by product categories.
- **Year Range Filter** – Adjusts time range for sales analysis.
